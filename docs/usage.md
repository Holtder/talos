# The Job system
Both the Apple and Google app stores limit how many connections a device can send a request to their servers at the same time. 
This means that any device, wether that would be your smart device or the server running Talos, can only send one query at a time. 
If you want to use Talos to gather data with fifty separate search terms, that would require you to wait for each query to complete before submitting a new one.
With this is mind, Talos was designed with a queue system.
Each query, or 'Job', is submitted one after another.
With this method, a user can submit queries one after another without delay!

> **WARNING:** The usage guide assumes that the reader has completed the [installation](installation.md) manual and has started a Talos WSL server as explained in the final step.
