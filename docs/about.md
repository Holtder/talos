# What is Talos?
Talos is a [self hosted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-hosting_(web_services)) search engine for mobile applications, both on Android and Apple smart devices. It can be a great tool for those who want to get a concise overview of all available applications within a certain region of the world.

Talos was initially developed as a "quick and dirty" tool for a research project on the availability of applications regarding infection prevention in the clinical setting.
The development of Talos quickly ran out of hand and became a full-fat tool that anyone can use.

## What's in a name?
As the research project behind the search engine was a study on technology in medicine, we looked for references in history and mythology where technology was used for the well-being of others. 
Enter [Talos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talos_(automaton)), an animated statue/robot and the closest anything in Greek mythology came to resemble modern machinery. It was built to protect those on Crete from pirates and invaders.

Ender Holten, or [Holtder](https://github.com/Holtder), is a medical student currently doing clerkships at hospitals connected to the University of Leiden; he also is the developer of Talos.
As a doctor-to-be, Ender is interested in internal medicine, eHealth and medical microbiology.
For his masters thesis he aimed to create an overview and review of available tools in the world of mobile health applications that might aid in preventing [nosocomial infections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital-acquired_infection).

Ender's penchant for including all things nerdy in other aspects of his life (see: Talos) started from an early moment in his life, when he was named after the main character of a [science-fiction novel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender%27s_Game).
When not at work, Ender plays boardgames/computergames, paints miniatures or runs a campaign in Dungeons and Dragons.
