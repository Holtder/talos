# What is Talos?
Talos is a [self hosted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-hosting_(web_services)) search engine for mobile applications, both on Android and Apple smart devices. It can be a great tool for those who want to get a concise overview of all available applications within a certain region of the world.

Talos was initially developed as a "quick and dirty" tool for a research project on the availability of applications regarding infection prevention in the clinical setting.
The development of Talos quickly ran out of hand and became a full-fat tool that anyone can use.

## What's in a name?
As the research project behind the search engine was a study on technology in medicine, we looked for references in history and mythology where technology was used for the well-being of others. 
Enter [Talos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talos_(automaton)), an animated statue/robot and the closest anything in Greek mythology came to resemble modern machinery. It was built to protect those on Crete from pirates and invaders.
