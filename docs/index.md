## Installation
### Preparation
If you are the average user with no prior experience with Linux, you generally want to use WSL. Windows Subsystem for Linux is a Windows 10 tool that allows users to run a light instance of linux on their own computer without having to set up a complicated virtual machine or a separate server running Linux. In order to use Talos you will need the following:
- A windows 10 PC with WSL enabled
- Ubuntu 18.04 LTS installed on WSL

For a guide on getting this ready I suggest following the manual method found in [this guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10#manual-installation-steps). Make sure to select *Ubuntu 18.04* in step 6.

Once you have everything ready open up Ubuntu by opening the Start Menu and typing in Ubuntu 18.04 and selecting the first option. Follow instructions until you reach a prompt. To make sure your system is up to date run the following two commands:
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get upgrade
